Next steps to make this a working dev environment:
1. Install Yarn (or pnpm) and run `yarn` in the repo root.
2. Replace placeholder app scripts with real frameworks:
   - Admin: create React app (Vite/CRA) with TypeScript and set dev/build scripts.
   - Customer: create Next.js app with TypeScript and set dev/build scripts.
   - Mobile: initialize Expo or React Native with TypeScript.
3. Add runtime dependencies to backend (Express/fastify) and dev dependencies like ts-node-dev.
4. Wire shared packages (import from '@packages/*') and build them as needed.
5. Set up CI/CD for Vercel (apps) and Render (backend).
